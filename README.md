  - Shit we want:

      TLDs to Consider
      .space
      .wtf ($25)
      .lol
      .sucks
      .not
      .ptth
      (...and more!)
    - Tracked votes
      - by Family
      - by Species
      - by Individiual
      (basically we want a taxonomy of cute animals)
      - by User
      - (Maybe a recommendation engine?)
    - User access
      - can access without login
      - OAuth (Facebook login, basic authentication)


Thoughts about votes in database:
  - have a new Battle object for each time a pair of animals do battle
    - track number of wins for both animals in this object and the number of battles
